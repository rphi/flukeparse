flukeparse

This is a quick script which attempts to pull the data from the (propreitary) Fluke/Robin .FLK
file format generated by Fluke PAT testers such as the 6500-2 into something a bit more
manageable - in this case a Python object.

In theory I was going to use this to help build a replacement for the rather aged
[Fluke DMS](https://www.fluke.com/en-gb/product/fluke-software/fluke-dms-software) but that never 
quite happened.
